# Recycle Job 



We’re excited to release our Recycle Job script, developed in response to popular demand. This fully configurable script allows you to customize items, locations, progress bars, and notifications. It utilizes a few props and requires only ox_lib along with either qb-target or ox_target. Compatible with ESX, QBCore, and Qbox frameworks, this script offers flexibility and ease of use. As always, we provide the same high level of support for this free script as we do for our paid ones via our Discord.


## Compatibility & Dependencies

**Frameworks:** ESX, Qbox, QBCore

**Resources:** ox_lib, ox_target or qb-target


## Installation

 - Drag and drop the resource into your server's resource folder
 - Add the item 'recycle' to your server's database or inventory system
 - Configure the items table in the config file to your servers needs
 - Set up your Discord webhook for logging.
